Hello! My name is Nikolai Mamashev.

2
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:30,003
I would like to create Pepper and Carrot motion comic.
( www.peppercarrot.com )

3
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:40,145
Originally, Pepper and Carrot is an Open Source web-comic created by David Revoy.

4
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,186
My intention is to create its' animated version.

5
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:58,065
For this I will be using Blender3d (www.blender.org/) and Krita (www.krita.org) Open Source Software.

6
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:09,439
To make this possible, I have started a crowd funding campaign.

7
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:19,173
With the success of this campaign, I will be able to create episode of this motion comic.

8
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:25,782
Well, if you're still watching this, then I guess you already know what to do!

00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:33,144
