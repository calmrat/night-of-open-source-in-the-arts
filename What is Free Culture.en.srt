FBI Warning ... DO NOT COPY THIS TAPE!

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,073
Copying is not theft!

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:07,964
Copying is not theft!

4
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:11,409
Stealing a thing, leaves one less left.

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,074
Copying it makes one thing more.

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:14,074
That's what copying is for.

7
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:19,566
Copying is not theft!

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,347
If I copies yours there's one thing more...

9
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:24,423
My ideas about copyright were that I believed it protected me.

10
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:29,470
One of the main questions of my dissertation is ...

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,168
... looking at the relationship between ethics and the free and open source software (FLOSS) movement.

12
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:39,692
And obviously there is a very strong ethic for information freedom.

13
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:48,187
What they have done is they have created the social and legal terms to cultivate technological production

14
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,492
Freedom doesn't protect itself.

15
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:55,203
You can give people freedom, but if they don't value it they'll lose it.

16
00:00:55,203 --> 00:01:04,725
The patent laws and the copyright laws are basically about 17th and 18th century conditions

17
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:12,162
implemented in 19th century way and then redeployed in the 20th century...

18
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,293
... to meet 21st century problems.

19
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:18,788
Open Source will allow individuals to have greater control.

20
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:22,291
Personally, for me, I don't want my heart to be relying on closed source code ...

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,074
... that hasn't been reviewed.

22
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:27,442
It kinda breaks my heart that software and the rest of culture are so ...

23
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:32,548
... separate from each other because they're really not that different they're just culture.

24
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:36,847
The same principals apply to software and the rest of the cultural world.

25
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:42,176
You know films are disintegrating in cans, film negatives.

26
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:45,373
They can't be preserved because no one can spend the money preserving them ...

27
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,899
because it would violate copyright if they ever showed it.

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,256
This is just killing art.

29
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:52,020
There is so much culture that has been lost.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,138
It's just heart breaking.

31
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,807
Part of the problem has been people to understand ...

32
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:58,554
... that this is not an anti-copyright movement.

33
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:01,002
This is in fact, a pro-copyright movement.

34
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:05,907
It is a movement that is about making copyright make sense in the digital age.

35
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:07,978
But wait! How are creators going to get paid?!

36
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,418
All of these companies that wanted us to shut down ...

37
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:13,063
... only wanted it because we kinda ruined their business model.

38
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:18,210
We took "American Gods", a book that was still selling and selling very well.

39
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:25,573
And for a month they put it up completely free on their website and you could read it and download it.

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:35,161
What happened was that sales of my books through independent book stores ...

41
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,933
... because that is what we were measuring it through ...

42
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,724
... went up the following month 300%!

43
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:44,833
... at a gig and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $10 bill.

44
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:53,668
I'm sorry, I burned your CD from a friend.

45
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:57,421
But I read your blog and I know you hate your label.

46
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,857
I just want you to have this money.

47
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:03,836
And this starts happening all the time.

48
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:08,659
So, there is a lot of new thinking when it comes to business models on the internet.

49
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,948
... and the model is that content is free.

50
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:16,713
Zero's and one's are free and here's a river of zero's and one's...

51
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,719
Containers however are not free.

52
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,141
Here are some explains of containers:

53
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:25,120
You have a computer, disk, a book; these are physical things.

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,106
These are things you might consider dead.

55
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:33,118
The content in them is alive, but the container is not alive.

56
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:34,560
It is property and that's fine.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,152
They are not free. That's how artists make money now.

58
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:44,535
Not from porting the content, but from actually having good relations with the fans.

59
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:47,752
Sharing your work with fans is beneficial for everybody.

60
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,250
Fans distribute the work and they support you.

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,102
It's awesome.

62
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,746
We're only just getting started...

63
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,634
Fair Use Rationale:

64
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:55,038
Because some of the quoted interviews are not free-licensed themselves, we feel it is ...

65
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,500
... necessary to note that these are small quotes take for review and commentary purposes and fall well within the legal definition of "fair use".
