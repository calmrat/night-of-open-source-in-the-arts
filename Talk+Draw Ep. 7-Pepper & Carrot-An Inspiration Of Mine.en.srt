00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:09,700
What's going on YouTube!? This is Will. Welcome to Will Weekly! This is Talk + Draw Episode 7.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:17,544
Today I'll be doing a comic I came across about 5 months ago on random websites.

4
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:20,598
The author's name is David Revoy and the comic is called Pepper and Carrot.

5
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:28,658
It's a very well drawn, well written comic. I mean the stories... I think they're on Episode 10 and Episode 11 should be coming out shortly ...

6
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:35,181
They're very short comic books. Maybe about 8 or 10 panels. But they're very cute, very whimsical and very funny.

7
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:41,302
The two characters are very original. The artist takes you away to a whole other world with his drawings.

8
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:48,441
The style of his fantasy drawing is ... to me ... is remeniscent of the old school RPGs I used to play on Playstation ...

9
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:53,534
... like Suikoden or Chrono Cross or Final Fantasy 9 especially.

10
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:58,593
Actually the main character Pepper, she reminds me of a female version of Vivi.

11
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:08,312
Just a which or a mage ... but she has her own quirky little personality and after you read a few comics you'll grow to love her love the artistry of it as well.

12
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:18,448
One of the big things is the guy, he's at --> davidrevoy.com <--

13
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:23,588
and he's a very humble dude. He gives basic tutorials on how he does his craft ...

14
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:30,925
gives advice on the industry ... he writes out step by step how he made all his comics ...

15
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:38,897
... and it's actually really cool to read because he's utilizing Open Source and "permissive", 100% free and forever.

16
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:44,056
He puts his stuff online for free, absolutely. And he uses Open Source Software ...

17
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,242
... and I think the main software that he uses is called Krita (krita.org) ...

18
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:55,202
... and it's not as popular as Photoshop's, etc but I've actually played with Krita and I love the concept of it!

19
00:01:55,202 --> 00:02:00,322
It's a very simplistic interface and is very good for artists as far as doing flats and line arts.

20
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:06,408
And as you'll see on this video the way I do my line art can be kinda cumbersome depending on the type of art I'm doing.

21
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:13,552
The demo that I saw that he actually gave a tutorial for Krita was absolutely wonderful ...

22
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,421
... to the point where I reached out to the company and said when are you guys gonna have the Mac version ...

23
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:21,862
... because the one particular thing that I wanted to use has a bug with it on the Mac version of the software.

24
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:31,607
So they're still gonna work in that as they get a little more popular and I can't wait to have it because it will speed up my flatting process probably 3x at the least.

25
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:40,705
But yea, like I was saying, his name is David Revoy. These are his two characters. They are by no means any of my characters that I own.

26
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:49,514
This is me as a fan. I am going to tweet this to him and post it on his facebook to make sure he understands that I did it because he does accept fan art.

27
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:57,300
And this is just me paying homage to the characters and the creativity and the ability to take two unknown characters ...

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:05,578
... and after a few episodes of reading, you're entirely thrust into their world and you understand different individuals that encompass this world ...

29
00:03:05,578 --> 00:03:09,716
... as well as get to know the characters on that much more of a deep level.

30
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:15,135
I think that's a very impressive thing for an artist to be able to pull off in such a short period of time.

31
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,971
So I commend him 100% and I am 100% a fan of him.

32
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:27,285
This is the type of thing I hope to do with my personal IPs is to just create a character that takes you away that takes you away to an entirely world ...

33
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:31,175
... transport you and make you fall in love with them and make you want to see what their next adventures are.

34
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:38,883
See what they're up to and hopefully we can all be on the same page as artists and fans of art ... where we can have ...

35
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:44,254
... because the Internet is very key to this lifestyle because it's a very Open Source world now ...

36
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:48,572
... where you don't have to go the comic shop every week to get the newest comic. This is all on line.

37
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:55,590
So if we can have the same thought process that David Revoy has as far as having everything Open Source ...

38
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,424
... and using the "honor system" with pay ... because yes, artists, you do need to get paid ...

39
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:04,779
... but he's managed to capivate a nice fan base and they take care of him ...

40
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:10,544
... and I think it's a wonder thing and I'm definitely one of his fans and will be for the forseeable future.

41
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:14,670
So I just wanted to let you guys know. Thanks for watching! Hope you enjoyed the video.
