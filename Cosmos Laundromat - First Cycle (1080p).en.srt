5
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,181
Excuse me. Exuse me. Sir? Sir? Excuse me?

6
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,781
Oh, come on.

7
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:32,596
Do you have a moment, sir?

8
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,490
I'm kind of in the middle of something here. Yes? Thank you.

9
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,833
I've come a long way for you, Frank.

10
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,117
My name is Victor.

11
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:53,073
Hi.

12
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,241
And you are....

13
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,893
You are Frank.

14
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:02,668
Wow, you are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?

15
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,428
Oh yeah? How would you know?

16
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,657
Look at you. You're an adventurer, Frank.

17
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:17,485
Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.

18
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:22,426
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?

19
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,337
No, one doesn't.

20
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,659
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.

21
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:34,013
Or does one?

22
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,704
Well, mister... errrr.... Hector....

23
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,061
Vitctor.... Victor.

24
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:45,391
I don’t know what you’re on about but I'm just a sheep minding its own business.

25
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,197
And I suggest you do the same.

26
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,550
No. No no no, Frank. Wait wait wait.

27
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:54,475
No. This is not... the way.

28
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:58,314
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

29
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:02,204
Precious time? Hehehe.

30
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:04,432
Yeah just give me one minute.

31
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:08,125
You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

32
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,025
Okay half. Half a minute.

33
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,678
I knew it. I knew it.

34
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,042
You will not regret this...

35
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,660
The adventures you will have.

36
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,182
All the lives you've ever wanted.

37
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,505
All you’ve been missing.

38
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:46,450
Here. This is... the best product we have... in store.

39
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,866
Variable spin speed, excellent tumble performance...

40
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:53,190
...in one... handy... device. Squeaky clean.

41
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,266
Well this... this better be good.

42
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:03,936
Took me ages to tie that rope.

43
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,877
With my fucking hooves.

44
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,344
No more need for hooves.

45
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,711
No more sheepy business.

46
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,210
Ho! Time flies.

47
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,880
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

48
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:18,842
How does this thing work?

49
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,151
I mean, how do I make it work?

50
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:21,648
No you don't.

51
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:24,170
I just turned it on for you.

52
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,575
When can I go?

53
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:30,214
Where can I go?

54
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:33,345
We will pick you up. Don't worry, just stay here.

55
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,182
In this exact place.

56
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,339
Don't move. Just wait.

57
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,186
That's it?

58
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:42,053
Hey!

59
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:42,845
Hey!

60
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:45,655
Wait, mister!

61
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,608
Ehh! Casper!

62
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:51,836
Hector, whatever!
