1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,805
For more than 2000 years ...

2
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:16,091
... humanity was stuck in the footsteps of it's ancestors ...

3
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:20,386
... trying to keep our world in reach of our tiny minds.

4
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:27,983
We called a fraction of a portion of space our holy nation to defend from all intruders.

5
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:36,351
Stuck in this loop of simplicity it took some time until the creators amongst us surpassed their counters ...

6
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:41,994
... we became wonders amongst the stars.

7
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,737
Leaving for new, distant frontiers.

8
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:59,993
And in a sea of redish dust ... we found a fountain of life ...

9
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,268
"Commander? What do I do?"

10
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:15,717
The intimations of a future in a life bursting universe and it's composition of infinity freed us from our human constraints.

11
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,148
We found water on Mars.

12
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:37,311
So we did what any self-respecting civilization would ...

13
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:50,906
... make beer!

14
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,556
Beer from Mars
