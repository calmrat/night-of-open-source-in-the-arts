1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Downtown Billy

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They used to call him "Downtown" Billy.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,500
"Downtown" had these long arms and he swung them
with abandon and with great force.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,000
when you fought "Downtown" Billy

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,000
you never knew where the punches were coming from:

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
"They come from Downtown ..."

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,000
"Downtown" once rose all the way to #4 in his weight class,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
then he dropped out of the first ten.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,000
then he fell to fighting 6 rounders, then 4.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,400
the punches still came from Downtown

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,200
but you could see them coming.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,000
then he was just a sparring partner.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
last I heard he left town.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,500
today I feel like "Downtown" Billy,

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,000
sitting in this blue garden chair under the walnut tree,

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,500
watching the neighbor boy bounce a basketball,

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
take some fancy steps forward,

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,500
then loop the ball through the hoop over the garage door.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,000
I have just taken my pills.
