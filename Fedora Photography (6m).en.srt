00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,366
In this video I take a look at the fedora design suite and decide if it's a good operating system (OS) for photographers running Linux.

2
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,815
Learn PHOTOGRAPHY

3
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:14,691
Discover OPEN SOURCE

4
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:24,238
I haven't found too many Linux OS's out there that are really aimed at photographers.

5
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:31,046
There is a cool little spin of Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) and Xubuntu and they have a great collection of photography apps right out of the box.

6
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:37,898
However, I like to use the GNOME desktop environment and that's what lead me to try the Fedora Design Suite.

7
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:41,927
The Fedora Design Suit is a spin of the regular Fedora workstation.

8
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:46,963
It includes tools that Fedora Design team uses to create artwork for the project.

9
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:51,262
So this includes stuff like the default wallpapers for all the different releases...

10
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,921
... the cool badges that the contributors receive ...

11
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,159
... the various websites for the Fedora Project ...

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,470
... and a whole lot of other things like posters, t-shirts, cd-labels and other printed material.

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,810
So the main focus of this distribution isn't only photography, but design in general.

14
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,601
First though, I just want to focus on some of the photography software that's included.

15
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:22,701
Ideally, after I install my operating system I want to be ready to edit my photos without spending a lot of time installing and configuring applications.

16
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:26,781
The Fedora Design Suit does a pretty good job this by including applications like ...

17
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:30,570
... my favorite Open Source raw photo editor Darktable (http://www.darktable.org/) ...

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,078
And Darktable isn't just a raw photo editor. It's also a photo manager.

19
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:40,272
So this is where I can rate my images, I can add keywords, I can search through my photo collection.

20
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:43,819
It's really the foundation of my photography workflow in Linux.

21
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:49,190
So I love that this is installed by default and I wish more OS's included it.

22
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,882
Not surprisingly, GIMP (www.gimp.org/) is also included by default.

23
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:57,063
Despite what you might hear on-line, GIMP is actually an excellent photography tool.

24
00:01:57,063 --> 00:02:01,237
Especially if you want to touch up your photos after you have completed all your raw edits.

25
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:06,974
And what's really important here is the Fedora Design Suite doesn't just include the default version of GIMP ...

26
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:17,446
It actually includes a lot of extra plugins that add functionality like a high-pass filter, a liquid rescale feature and the really popular "gimic" filter collection.

27
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:20,845
So it's things like this that really make it better for photographers.

28
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:25,159
It saves me time coming in afterwards and installing all these extra plugins.

29
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,956
Some other helpful tools that are installed by default include "Hugin" ...

30
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:34,415
... this allows you to create panaramas by stitching several photos together.

31
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,437
... "Shotwell" the photo organizer is in there.

32
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:44,981
I don't use it myself. It's not a color managed application but it is very popular so I'm sure many people will be happy to see it there.

33
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,393
Ummm... If you love the command line then you're probably familiar with "ImageMagik" ...

34
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:51,875
... this allows you to do some batch processing on the command line.

35
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:58,782
Something that I was surprised to see which I think is awesome is there are extra ICC color profiles installed by default.

36
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:03,718
You might not be familiar with these, but things like "Adobe RGB" and "ProPhoto RGB".

37
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,749
These profiles are already installed right out of the box.

38
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:10,731
And that's another little thing that's a great little timesaver for me.

39
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:16,777
Since the Fedora Design Suit uses the GNOME desktop environment it also includes the GNOME color manager.

40
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:22,901
This is a great little tool that makes it easy for you to callibrate your monitor and manage color profiles.

41
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:28,507
And since color management is an essential part of photography, it's great that this is included by default.

42
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:33,328
Althought I'm not really surprised, you do see this in other OS's now.

43
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:39,963
So when you put all these applications together, you really end up with a great collection of photography tools right out of the box.

44
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:43,849
It's definitely better than you'll find in most popular Linux Distributions.

45
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,111
It covers areas from color management, to photo management, to raw photo editing.

46
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,516
But of course everybody's photograhy workflow is different.

47
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:56,723
For me, the default applications aren't perfect but they are a really great start.

48
00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:00,395
On my website I outline my photography workflow on Linux.

49
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:05,069
If you have a look, you'll see I do change things like the default image viewer.

50
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,667
I add a program to download and rename my photos.

51
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:13,465
I also have to install a few more plugins for GIMP that aren't already included.

52
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:20,499
So what about all those other tools that I mentioned at the beginning for making posters, designing webpages, t-shirts and so on?

53
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:25,195
I'm sure many photographers won't need these but for me it actually works out really well.

54
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:32,223
I often use Inkscape (inkscape.org) to create vectors that I can use on my website and on YouTube thumbnail images.

55
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:36,761
There's a font manager and viewer which are great when I'm working on art for webpages.

56
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:40,310
I even use Scribus (scribus.net/) occasionaly to make some fancy PDFs.

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,760
The only extra's I don't really use are maybe Blender3d (www.blender.org) and the Synfig Studio (www.synfig.org)

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,530
However if I compare the Fedora Design Suite to something like Ubuntu Studio (ubuntustudio.org/) ...

59
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,662
... the Ubuntu Studio has a lot of extra audio and video applications that I don't use.

60
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,357
It's also about a gigabyte larger in size.

61
00:04:57,357 --> 00:05:03,130
So the Fedora Design Suite is definitely a better fit for me and possibly other photographers out there as well.

62
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,772
Over the years I ran various flavors of Ubuntu. And the transition to Fedora wasn't entirely smooth.

63
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,963
However I'm really happy with the change.

64
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:16,418
Out of the box the Fedora Design Suite had a great selection of photography tools.

65
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:20,877
I didn't have to spent as much time installing plugins and other software.

66
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:25,695
So if you're a Linux photographer and you like to have the latest and greatest version of the GNOME desktop environment ...

67
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:31,419
... I really encourage you to check it out. It might turn out to be a great fit for you.
