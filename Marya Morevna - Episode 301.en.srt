00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,300
Morevna Project...

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
...in association with "Adamant" Art School of Gorno-Altaisk...

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
presents

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,440
"Falcon", "Falcon", respond. This is "Hawk". What's your status?

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,880
Hey officer, can I help you somehow?

6
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,970
Stay away, stay away!

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,980
I am a government agent!

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,600
I know, I know...

9
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,170
And I am the owner of this mansion.

10
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,490
The Beautiful Princess Marya Morevna

11
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:30,715
Episode 3: Underground

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,980
Ah, Marya Morevna, I just can't get it.

13
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,360
We aren't that rich, but they are coming here like bees to a...

14
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,289
...honeypot!

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,650
I am not a bee, I am a "Hawk".

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,690
Spread your wings, Hawk.

17
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,520
But it seems like you're having fun.

18
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,620
Of course I do!

19
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,540
But say, why did you drop my favorite toolbox on him?

20
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,460
I just can't figure out what you have done to them, if they are after you that much...

21
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,200
I have no idea.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,920
Going somewhere?

23
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,660
I am going to a biker party, and I won't get back until tomorrow.

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,850
Dinner on plate, firewood in shed, dog's food under bathtub...

25
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,890
Do we have dogs here?

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,560
...in case of a power outage, turn on the electric generator and don't forget to restart the air defense system.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,140
Here are the keys to all the doors in the mansion.

28
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,290
Feel free to go anywhere, but don't touch this key and don't unlock the door it opens.

29
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,890
But why?

30
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,090
Because I've said so!

31
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,300
Well, bye...

32
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,960
So, dear, I can have some fun with you then.

33
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,050
Hm, it seems this lovely evening is under threat.

34
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,620
Stay here, I'll be right back.

35
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,280
Caption on the door: "Underground"

36
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,700
Aha, here it is!

37
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,050
What?

38
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,520
This is...

39
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,800
...feel free to go anywhere, but don't touch this key...

40
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Hey, is anybody here?

41
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,040
There is something wrong with your engine here.

42
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,040
Damn youâ€¦

43
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Ah? Who is it?

44
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Come on...

45
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,360
My name is Ivan Tsarevich... and I am very good at fixing things.

46
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,560
Inside...

47
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,240
There...

48
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,200
The framework is quite unusual. It will be a challenge to get inside.

49
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,880
So, let's start!

50
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,090
Yes...

51
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,490
Excellent...

52
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,720
Well done.

53
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Certainly, you've got a talent...

54
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,220
This is not the hardest one...

55
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,960
Still, it's quite strange that it's so tricking to open this thing...

56
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,760
Well, that's all.

57
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,900
Open Sesame!

58
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,420
What's up? You are almost there!

59
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,490
I don't know... there seems to be some piece of paper here... I'm going to remove it now.

60
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
Oh, no...
