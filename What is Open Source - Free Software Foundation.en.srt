1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,710
Software is all around us ...

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,727
... and sometimes inside us.

3
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:11,646
But what happens when the tools we use ...

4
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:13,433
... are obeying someone else?

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:17,364
A tool you can control serves your interests!

6
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,527
But if someone else controls it ...

7
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,803
... they serve their own ...

8
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:25,574
When you can examine tools to see how they work ...

9
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,620
... you are able to learn about them ...

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,819
... even modify them to work differently or better.

11
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:35,092
When you can share a tool and its changes ...

12
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,047
... you help others and in turn they help you.

13
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:43,293
In fact, this is how early computing developed.

14
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,609
Everyone could see a program's code.

15
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,585
And people shared their work freely to drive its' growth.

16
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,441
Every user was a potential author.

17
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:59,667
But when companies began to lock source code away ...

18
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:03,057
... it stopped being possible to participate.

19
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:07,075
Or even to know what the code was doing.

20
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:12,090
In reponse, hackers formed the GNU project ...

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,891
... to create a computer system designed to respect the autonomy of users.

22
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,213
The adopted a copyleft maneuver ...

23
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:23,306
... and built it into the GNU General public License (GPL) ...

24
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:26,602
... a legal structure that preserves user rights.

25
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:32,214
In ten short years, the Free Software movement had produced the GNU Linux system.

26
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:36,196
Computing that nobody could own, but anyone could use.

27
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,546
Today it's keeping planes in the air ...

28
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:44,305
Stocks trading ...

29
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:48,734
... and the global internet running.

30
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:53,497
We all encounter free software in invisible ways.

31
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:57,049
But software freedom was designed for people.

32
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,589
It's about what shape the technology we create will take.

33
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:04,494
And what kind of society we use our digital powers to build.

34
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,137
We still have work to do.

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,724
